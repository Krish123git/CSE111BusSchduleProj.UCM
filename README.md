CSE 111: Bus Schedule Data Management System

Course: CSE 111 - Database Systems, Fall 2025


Current Repository Files and Their Purpose:
Below is a description of the files currently available in the repository, relating them back to the project requirements:

BuSchema.sql
Purpose: This file contains the foundational SQL commands (CREATE TABLE...) that define the structure of our bus schedule database. It transforms the logical E/R diagram into physical database tables (like route, stop, driver, etc.), fulfilling the relational specification requirement and the implementation requirement for Phase2.

DatabasesIntroProject2025Fall.pdf
Purpose: A slideshow for showcasing Phase1 containing the original schema, UML, and E/R diagrams. A rough draft.

ER_Diagram_Draft3.drawio.png
Purpose: This image file provides the visual Entity-Relationship (E/R) Diagram. It is the core database design document for Checkpoint 1, illustrating our entities, attributes, and the relationships between them (including the required many-to-many relationships) before they were converted to SQL tables.

Phase1.pdf
Purpose: This PDF outlines the specific requirements for Phase 1. It specifies the due date, the points awarded, and a detailed list of materials required for submission, including the UML use case diagrams, E/R diagrams, and relational schema. It serves as the official guide for what needs to be accomplished and presented for this stage of the project.

Phase2.pdf
Purpose: This PDF outlines the specific requirements for Phase 2. It specifies the due date, the points awarded, and a detailed list of materials required for submission, including a presentation, a database with sample data, a script of SQL statements, and a demo. It also specifies that two files must be included in the GitHub repository: a database file with all relations and data, and a script with all the SQL statements.

Project.pdf
Purpose: This PDF is the official course document outlining the project requirements, checkpoints, grading criteria, and instructions for the CSE 111 course. It acts as the master documentation for project scope and rules.

README.md (this file)
Purpose: This file is to provide an overview of the contents of this repo.

UML Use Case - Bus Project.drawio.png
Purpose: This file contains the UML Use Case Diagram. It visually maps out the main actors (e.g., Passenger, Driver) and the key functions they perform within the system (e.g., "Using the Trip Planner," "View Schedule"). This serves as the project requirement specification document for Checkpoint 1.
